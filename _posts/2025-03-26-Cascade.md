- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.
	
	```python
	nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 3000 -Pn -sS 10.10.10.182 -oG scan
	/opt/extractports scan
	nmap -p53,88,135,139,389,445,636,3268,3269,5985,49154,49155,49157,49158,49165 -sCV -Pn 10.10.10.182 -oN ports
	```

- I found the domain `cascade.local` and I add it to the file in the `hosts` file
- I start enumerating the users that belong to the system with enum4linux, obtain a list and validate them with kerbrute .
	
	```python
	enum4linux 10.10.10.182
	/opt/kerbrute userenum -d cascade.local --dc 10.10.10.182 usernames 
	```

- Having a general idea of the users of the system, I decide to list more information about each of them.

	```python
	ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.10.182 -x -b "DC=cascade,DC=local"
	```

- While reviewing these users' information, I find a field that appears to contain a possible password for the user **r.thompson**.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e46c89-5ee9-4870-ae80-bf401b577c5e)

- I convert the possible password found in base64 and validate it with the list of users I have previously found. I find that the password is valid for the user r.thompson.

	```python
	netexec smb 10.10.10.182 -u usernames -p XXXXXXX
	```

- With these valid credentials I list the shared resources by SMB and I see that I have read permissions on the “Data” directory which is not common.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0efffd73-57f8-450d-8ca1-a7079d07286c)

- I connect to the directory and within it I find several relevant files.
	
	```python
	smbclient  \\\\10.10.10.182\\Data --user=r.thompson  --password=XXXXXXX 
	```

- I find an email stating that the user “TempAdmin” has the same password as the Administrator account. Reviewing the users that I had found so far I see that this is no longer part of the system so it must have been deleted at some point.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8897beee-4dd5-4d9b-a929-375834b8b584)

- In another directory I find a configuration file for a VNC, inside this I find a capo that indicates a password in hexadecimal. I try to revert it but I get several unreadable characters so I have to look for another way to get it.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3391b5c3-abcf-4dfa-8271-dd187ebcebbe)

	```python
	echo "6bXXXXXXXXXXXX0f" | xxd -ps -r > password_vnc
	```

- After searching for information about Virtual Network Computing (VNC), I find a github repository by [jeroennijhof](https://github.com/jeroennijhof/vncpwd) that allows to revert the password by passing the complete configuration file. By using this script I manage to get a clear text password. I validate it with the user listing I had previously found and it tells me that it belongs to the user s.smith.

- I verify if with the credentials of this user I can connect to the system through WinRM and it tells me that I can. I connect and I can read the first flag of the system.
	
	```python
	netexec winrm 10.10.10.182 -u s.smith -p XXXXXXX
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u s.smith -p XXXXXXX
	```

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ad8534-e79c-415a-b613-b0b583f40ac6)

- Listing the users of the system I notice that there is the user ArkSvc that belongs to the group “AD Recycle Bin”. This group has the ability to read objects that have been deleted in the system.

	```python
	ldapdomaindump -u 'cascade.local\s.smith' -p 'XXXXXXX' 10.10.10.182
	```

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b7c1f18-215d-4950-8758-11525b9f244d)

- As we had previously read in an email, the user “TempAdmin” had the same password as the administrator so if we can become ArkSvc, we have a chance to read the deleted TempAdmin object and get its password in order to escalate our privileges and become Administrator.

- I start by looking information about the user I have credentials for, s.smith. It strikes me that he belongs to two unusual fields, IT and Audit share. 
	
	```python
	net users s.smith
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e059cf-d5a7-4594-b543-9f23454db303)

-  While researching information about this second group, I come across a comment mentioning a path to a potential resource. I access it and discover an application along with its DLL files, configuration files, and a database named **"Audit.db"**.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20bed47b-cf78-494d-8c14-41b2359ce0e1)

- I bring the database to my machine and when I open it I find in a table the user ArkSvc and an encrypted password. 

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/762bd3df-8739-4132-bc3e-13ba4eb76dbf)

- I try to brute force the password in clear text and I am not able to get it so I have to analyze the program to understand how this encrypted password has been constructed.
- I download all the program files to run them through [dotpeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/decompiler/) to be able to analyze its code.
- Inside the code I find the function used to encrypt the passwords. It uses AES encryption and within the code itself appears both the IV and the Key so I can get the password in clear text. For this I use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and I get the password. 

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2fb9870-ba67-4a47-9cf3-dfa2acf4e92e)

- I validate the password for the ArkSvc user and confirm that it belongs to them. Using these credentials, I successfully log into the system via WinRM.

	```python
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u ArkSvc -p XXXXXXX 
	```

- As the user ArkSvc, and assuming that members of the AD Recycle Bin group can read the deleted TempAdmin object, I execute the query:

	```python
	Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -includeDeletedObjects -Properties *
	#If I want to query only the TempAdmin object
	Get-ADObject -filter {isDeleted -eq $true -and DisplayName -eq "TempAdmin"} -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties *
	```

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f9110a2-0328-4467-a348-87804c689ddc)

- I decode the password from Base64 and validate it. It works for the Administrator user, so I connect to the system via WinRM as this user and successfully retrieve the second system flag.

	```python
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles 
	```
