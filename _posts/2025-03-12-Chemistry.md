- - I start with a scan of the open ports and I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found
    
    ```python
    nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 5000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.35 -oG scan
    /opt/extractports scan
    nmap -p22,5000 -sCV -Pn 10.10.11.38 -oN ports
    ```
